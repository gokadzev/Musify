/// Base class for implementations of [AudioHandler]. It provides default
/// implementations of all methods and streams. Each stream in this class is
/// specialized as either a [BehaviorSubject] or [PublishSubject] providing an
/// additional `add` method for emitting values on those streams.
///
/// These are [BehaviorSubject]s provided by this class:
///
/// * [playbackState]
/// * [queue]
/// * [queueTitle]
/// * [androidPlaybackInfo]
/// * [ratingStyle]
///
/// Besides them, there's also [customEvent] which is a [PublishSubject].
///
/// You can choose to implement all methods yourself, or you may leverage some
/// mixins to provide default implementations of certain behaviours:
///
/// * [QueueHandler] provides default implementations of methods for updating
/// and navigating the queue.
/// * [SeekHandler] provides default implementations of methods for seeking
/// forwards and backwards.
///
/// ## Android service lifecycle and state transitions
///
/// On Android, the [AudioHandler] runs inside an Android service. This allows
/// the audio logic to continue running in the background, and also an app that
/// had previously been terminated to wake up and resume playing audio when the
/// user click on the play button in a media notification or headset.
///
/// ### Foreground/background transitions
///
/// The underlying Android service enters the `foreground` state whenever
/// [PlaybackState.playing] becomes `true`, and enters the `background` state
/// whenever [PlaybackState.playing] becomes `false`.
///
/// ### Start/stop transitions
///
/// The underlying Android service enters the `started` state whenever
/// [PlaybackState.playing] becomes `true`, and enters the `stopped` state
/// whenever [PlaybackState.processingState] becomes `idle`.
///
/// ### Create/destroy lifecycle
///
/// The underlying service is created either when a client binds to it, or when
/// it is started, and it is destroyed when no clients are bound to it AND it is
/// stopped. When the Flutter UI is attached to an Android Activity, this will
/// also bind to the service, and it will unbind from the service when the
/// Activity is destroyed. A media notification will also bind to the service.
///
/// If the service needs to be created when the app is not already running, your
/// app's `main` entrypoint will be called in the background which should
/// initialise your [AudioHandler].
